            <p>Interconnection: History of Scientific Theories
                The interconnection between history and science is evident in the evolution of scientific theories. Scientific progress does not occur in a vacuum; it is influenced by historical context, cultural shifts, and technological advancements.
                
                Example: The Heliocentric Theory
                The transition from the geocentric model (Earth-centered universe) to the heliocentric model (Sun-centered universe) illustrates the interplay between history and science. Proposed by Copernicus in the 16th century, the heliocentric theory faced significant resistance due to prevailing religious and cultural beliefs. However, it laid the groundwork for modern astronomy. Galileo's subsequent observations, supported by the invention of the telescope, provided further evidence for the heliocentric model. This shift in understanding revolutionized science, demonstrating how historical context and technological advancements shape scientific theories.</p>
